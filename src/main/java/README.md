## Greeter

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Twofer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for X, one for me.
```

Where X is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |String to return
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bob     |One for Bob, one for me.
|""      |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.
